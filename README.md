Presented by Iris Yang (Arup) on 11 March 2020Brining BIM model into GIS is commonly used to help stakeholders understand about the location of the project sits. In this web application, we take a step further.  
BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) is a widely adopted open standard for issue tracking in BIM software. BCF data includes viewports and associated information of design issues, clashes, comments at locations. Integration of GIS and BCF provides spatial visualization of BIM issues information that can benefit the process during design review.
